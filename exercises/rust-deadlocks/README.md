# rust-deadlocks

## Goal
Fix a bug that causes the program to hang and never complete execution.

## The Mission
1. **Open the directory:** Open the `project/` directory in your terminal.
2. **Initialize Claude Code:** Run the command `claude`.
3. **Trigger Plan Mode:** Press `Shift+Tab` to enter **Plan Mode**, then paste:

> Perform a system analysis to identify why cargo run hangs and the program never completes. Analyze the source code to identify the root cause, propose a plan to fix the issue, implement new tests to verify the fix, and ensure everything passes with both cargo run and cargo test.
